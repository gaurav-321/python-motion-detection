# Motion Detection & Notification System ðŸŽ¥ðŸ¤–

## Description

The Motion Detection & Notification System is a Python program that detects motion in a video feed using OpenCV and sends notifications via Telegram when motion is detected. It leverages environment variables for configuration and includes basic error handling.

## Features

- **Motion Detection**: Utilizes OpenCV's background subtraction and contour detection to identify motion.
- **Telegram Notifications**: Sends photos and text messages to a configured Telegram chat when motion is detected or if the DVR is offline.
- **Error Handling**: Basic exception handling to notify via Telegram if something goes wrong.

## Installation

To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/gag3301v/python-motion-detection.git
   cd python-motion-detection
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file and set the following environment variables:
   ```
   TELEGRAM_API_ID=your_telegram_api_id
   TELEGRAM_API_HASH=your_telegram_api_hash
   TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_telegram_chat_id
   DVR_URL=http://your_dvr_url
   ```

## Usage

Hereâ€™s how you can use the program:

1. **Run the Motion Detection Script**:
   ```sh
   python motion_detection.py
   ```

2. **Example Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   from motion_detector import MotionDetector, TelegramNotifier

   # Initialize classes
   motion_detector = MotionDetector()
   telegram_notifier = TelegramNotifier()

   # Start motion detection loop
   while True:
       if motion_detector.detect_motion():
           telegram_notifier.send_notification("Motion detected!", "path/to/screenshot.jpg")
   ```

## Configuration

The script uses environment variables for configuration. Set the following in your `.env` file:

- `TELEGRAM_API_ID`: Your Telegram bot's API ID.
- `TELEGRAM_API_HASH`: Your Telegram bot's API hash.
- `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`: The chat ID where notifications will be sent.
- `DVR_URL`: URL of the DVR to monitor.

## Tests

This project does not include automated tests at this time. However, you can manually test motion detection and notification functionality by running the script and checking your Telegram chat.
